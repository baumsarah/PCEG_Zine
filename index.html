                    <h2>Dear reader,</h2>
                    <p class="context">
                        PCEG (PARC Community Engagement Group) is a group of Brandeis students who have been impacted by sexual violence, dating/domestic violence, stalking and/or harassment.
                        Our group is facilitated by PARC student members, but PCEG is independent and entirely student-run. 
                        We have had meetings regularly together over the course of several months, in which we read and discussed readings and topics relating to anti-violence activism. 
                        A lot of our focus was on anti-oppression and confronting the history of racism within some mainstream anti-violence movements, as well as acknowledging that the majority of progress that has been made in anti-violence activism has come from Black Women and Femmes (although this work is often co-opted by white activists).<br><br> 
                        We support anti-violence responses that are also anti-policing and anti-incarceration. 
                        At the end of our time reading and learning together, we chose this zine project to center the voices of people who’ve experienced violence and to stimulate interest in anti-violence activism in the community.<br><br>

                        We decided to create a zine because zine-ing is a great format for getting the voices of a small non-professional group to be heard.
                        We owe a lot of inspiration to the riot grrrl movement of feminist zines, but have intentionally chosen not to directly mimic their style. 
                        We want to be conscious of the fact that many people and ideas in the in the riot grrrl movement were hostile or exclusionary towards women of color and exclusive to cisgender women.
                        We want this zine to be a space for stories of people of all races, genders, sexualities, and abilities, and inclusive of all experiences of violence.
                        We are also committed to viewing sexual violence, dating/domestic violence, stalking, and sexual harrassment as connected to other forms of violence, including, but not limited to, racial violence.<br><br>

                        For this zine, we chose the theme of letters.
                        Letters have had various significant roles depending on their recipient.
                        We can send letters to people as a form of direct communication, send letters to governments and institutions as a form of political action, send letters to strangers to create connections and build community, and keep letters to ourselves as a form of venting and healing.
                        This project is an open letter to the world that aims to combine these purposes.
                        The letters themselves are a work of expression and a willingness to be seen.
                        We hope that putting this zine into the world will allow people to hear the direct stories of people impacted by violence, help to build a sense of connection, encourage activism, and help guide self-reflection and healing.
                    </p>

                    <p class="context">
                        We have created a list of action steps at the end of this zine to help achieve these goals.
                        We hope that this zine marks not just the end of a project, but also the beginning of a community change.

                            Dear mother,<br><br>
        
                            “We all go through bad relationships.”
                            I have just told you about justin, about his hands wringing out my self-esteem, his once comforting scent now poison stuck in my throat.<br><br>
                                        
                            I have just told you and you look away from me.<br><br> 
                                    
                            I need you to say that I don’t deserve this. That I don’t deserve abuse disguised as love, jealously disguised as safety, rape disguised as lovemaking. 
                            I need you to tell me I am more than this crime against me, my body, my soul.<br><br>
                                
                            I chaotically seek outside validation; I yearn for someone to see me, the way I need you to see me. I join BDSM groups; I have sex at any possible moment; I reek of desperation; I need to feel something; I need you to soothe the wounds. I needed you to see me for my trauma, for my sadness, for all of my moments,
                            I need you.<br><br>
                                    
                            “We are all living lives of quiet desperation.”
                            Your words tape my mouth shut, you see me as mistakes, as shame, as a stranger.
                            Your rigid, binary understanding of who deserves and who does not is deafening, it is damning. I quickly realize I do not fit into your box of those that deserve sympathy, that deserve help. It is my unshaven legs, it is my crop tops, it is my drinking, it is my party habits, it is my fault. <br><br>
                                    
                            I needed you to tell me I don’t deserve this. I need to hear that it is not my fault, that you believe me.<br><br>  
                                
                            I have just told you and you refuse to recognize me.<br><br>
                                
                            Your loving daughter,<br>

                            Dear younger self,<br><br>
                
                            I know you are going through a lot right now. 
                            Everything is overwhelming and confusing and really messed up. 
                            I wanted to start off and tell you that none of this is your fault. 
                            It’s okay to be scared right now. 
                            You probably don’t realize this yet, but you are being abused, and that’s not okay. 
                            I wish you could have told someone what was going on, but I understand wanting to hold it all in. 
                            It's hard to be in danger every day. 
                            Eventually you’re going to tell people what happened and you’re going to get help. 
                            Unfortunately, things are going to get harder before they get better, but that’s the process of recovery. 
                            You are capable of so much despite what happened. 
                            You will learn to trust others again and you will form meaningful relationships in your future. 
                            You are incredibly strong, and I know it’s really hard to think that right now, but you are going to get through this. 
                            I believe in you.<br><br>
                                    
                            Sincerely,<br>

                            To the whispers in my ear,<br><br>

                            It’s kind of you to visit on a day I’m feeling small. I wish I could write that I’d forgotten what you’d sounded like, but the impression you leave is always lingering somewhere in the corners of my brain. You have a lot of luggage with you this time; I suppose you’re planning on staying for a while. The sun continues to reach new heights in the sky, but I stay in bed, feeling stuck, only able to remain quiet and listen.<br><br>
                                
                            At the beginning, you nearly took me by surprise. 
                            Here you were, new to me, spouting things that I couldn’t even imagine someone saying aloud to me, but you were unafraid, unphased. 
                            You told me the whole thing was my fault. 
                            It all could’ve been easily avoided. 
                            You said that we could still be sitting together in his apartment, talking, having fun, being friends. 
                            I could be going to parties with him, dinners with friends. 
                            I didn’t have to stay over. 
                            I didn’t have to say yes when he asked if we could share a bed. 
                            When he asked if I was awake, I could’ve pretended to be fast asleep.<br><br>
                                
                            You were less of a whisper then, and more of a pounding in my head. 
                            You kept me up all night that night, and the day after that, you left no space in my mind for my own thoughts. 
                            The entire walk to the bus, and the entire bus ride home, you filled all the nooks and crannies of my brain, like a gas released into a complex and confusing container. 
                            I told her what he did, and it was her eyes that drove you away. 
                            As I recounted it to her, I let out a semblance of a laugh and averted my eyes. 
                            But once her voice hit my ear, I looked to see her eyes seeing mine.
                            “That’s not okay,” she said. 
                            Three words and you had crept out and in crept a new, lighter, but more solid, thing: a truth.<br><br>
                                
                            In time you returned.
                            Some days there was more of you, some days less. 
                            Some days there was none of you, and some days you were all there was. 
                            But each time you left, no matter how much time you’d been muttering ugly things, weighing my body down, you were always eventually replaced by a new truth. 
                            Your visits are often further spaced out now, and for that I feel immense relief. 
                            But when you do come visit, and I have no choice but to open the door, I’m no longer afraid. 
                            Because I know that you are made of nothing. 
                            You are blurry, insubstantial. 
                            You can cast a shadow fifty feet tall on the walls of my mind, but you yourself are inconsequential. 
                            Volume and weight doesn’t correspond to meaning. 
                            And now, each time the door slides closed behind you, I feel my bag of truths grow heavier. 
                            My truths that are strong and impenetrable. 
                            My truths that are solid and make up the ground that I stand on, walk on, fall on. 
                            My truths that are mine, always and forever.<br><br>
                                
                            Sincerely,<br>
                            One of your many rest-stops

                            Dear mom,<br><br>
                            Sorry for not telling you I wanted to but how do you bring something like that up? 
                            Interrupt in the middle of dinner to say oh btw I was assaulted anyways pass the butter? 
                            Besides I wouldn’t want you to worry because really I’m almost fine and what could that really do. 
                            But somehow it feels wrong not to tell, not to keep you updated on the ingredients that are making my adult self. 
                            You were my main ingredient you created me and made me real. 
                            And when you had to share me with the world you carefully monitored all my future ingredients until I learned to be secretive and started wanting to hide them from you. 
                            I tried to hide my real identity not because I didn’t want you to know but because I wanted it to be mine and I don’t think a mom can fully share. 
                            But at the same time I didn’t want to hide it, I wanted you there to see it to make me real. 
                            And maybe if I told you you’d tell me of some time in the eighties before “this metoo became popular” when you’d experienced something similar and we’d cry and bond and feel seen. 
                            Or maybe you’d hear me say it and worry about how it had changed me and see me with this new qualifier to my identity and both you and I would see my new identity as someone who’d been assaulted and that would become real.

                    <h4>Write to an incarcerated survivor</h4>
                    <p class="context">
                        The criminalization of survivors of sexual and dating/domestic violence is an enormous problem in our society.
                        According to the organization Survived and Punished, 94% of incarcerated women and people identified as women by the law have a history of physical or sexual abuse prior to their incarceration.
                        In the year 2012, after being incarcerated, nearly 40% of transgender people in U.S. prisons reported sexual assault or abuse, where the perpetrator was another prisoner or staff.
                        These statistics, which can be found <a href="https://survivedandpunished.org/quick-statistics/">here</a>, go to show that the U.S. prison system reproduces violence, and often already marginalized communities are hit the hardest.<br><br>
                        
                        Many survivors who have been incarcerated in the past and who are currently incarcerated say that receiving letters of support played/plays an important role in their well-being.
                        If you are interested in writing a letter to a person who survived sexual and/or domestic violence and is currently incarcerated, you can click <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeph_O3ykyl7QecLNbMg_8WRsYdi4TV9DGqsPNpkFTgEA6AuQ/viewform">here</a> for more information.

                        If you are a person who’s experienced violence, please feel free to upload your own letter/artwork at <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsxZw2u7UaRCj1u1J9AI6RXWv-m1khYd84YVgV0NQ_TMz7KQ/viewform">this link</a>.

                    <h4>Write a letter to yourself</h4>
                    <p class="context">
                        Reflecting on your own experiences with violence, whether it’s violence that happened directly to you, violence that impacted someone you care about, or violence in the world, can be valuable in and of itself.<br><br>
                        Members of this group have found that writing a letter to someone without the intention of sending it or making it public can be a great way to get all of your thoughts onto a page, unfiltered.

                        We want to thank you all for taking the time to read this, and to especially thank those who contributed.
                        The process of writing a letter and making it available to the public about experiences that are so personal and difficult to relive can be incredibly taxing to say the least.
                        We also want to acknowledge the strength that comes along with getting involved in other ways, and taking space for yourself when needed.
                        Overall, we just want to appreciate all of you for coming together and helping us create something really meaningful.
